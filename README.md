#exponent-push-expressjs

 Simple server to broadcast all devices with push notification with use of ExpressJS and Exponent Backend.

Implemented routes for listen and store tokens from devices and a route for send a message to all users connected (this is made with Exponent Backend, reason why I reuse exponent-node-sdk code)
